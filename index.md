# About Me

I am a third year Mechanical Engineering student minoring in Aerospace Engineering and Business with a passion for innovation. I have had the incredible expierences being involved with multiple engineering projects on and off campus which has given me the ability to perform holistically as an engineer. Metal Additive Manufacturing Research, a Formula One style engineering team, internships, and volunteer engineering work, have given me the opportunity to build my skill set and apply knowledge learned in the classroom to real world engineering problems. Experiences working in these organizations have given me the sense of intuition and holistic mindset required to solve new complex engineering problems.

My experiences being a design lead on Lehighâ€™s Formula SAE team taught me the different roles that innovation can play in problem solving. Operating with limited resources, I have constantly had to find new opportunities to reduce costs and manufacturing time which often result in producing novel methods for solving engineering related problems.

Being a mechanical engineering intern at SAVIT Corporation advanced my technical knowledge of mechanical systems and provided me with the industry experience required to view engineering problems holistically. I was able to use the collaborative skills that I learned from being a team lead in Formula SAE to work with a team of engineers to produce electromechanical prototypes with intertwined hardware and software components.

Considering its ability to make geometrically complex but perfectly optimized designs a reality, additive manufacturing is particularly underutilized in industry. Using a Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) printer, my research group and I are developing models for strength of metal 3D printed parts using thermal data, audio information, and LIDAR scans. Through optimizing the microstructure of metal additive manufactured parts, I hope to increase the knowledge associated with metal 3D printing so it can be utilized as a solution for a completely new set of problems.

Experience performing research, being a design lead on the Formula SAE team and past internships have taught me how new engineering methods have to be innovated for each new set of engineering environments and the holistic approach that every engineer should take. I hope to apply the skills I have learned from my past experiences to innovate new engineering methods for whatever challenges the future brings.
