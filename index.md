# About Me

I am an extremely motivated third year Mechanical Engineering student minoring in Aerospace Engineering and Business with a variety of out-of-classroom experience from being involved in research, internships, and a Formula One style racing team. These opportunities have provided me with a sense of intuition necessary to solve complex engineering problems which I hope to apply to a Summer 2020 internship.
