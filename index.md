# About Me

I am a third year Mechanical Engineering student minoring in Aerospace Engineering and Business with a passion for innovation. I have had incredible opportunities of being able to be involved in multiple engineering projects on and off campus which has given me the ability to become a more well versed engineer. My desire to become a well-versed engineer has motivated me to apply skills learned in the classroom to metal 3D printing research, a Formula One style engineering team, internships, and volunteer work. These opportunities have provided me with the sense of intuition required to solve complex engineering problems. 

My experiences being a design lead on Lehighâ€™s Formula SAE team taught me the different roles that innovation can play in solving engineering problems. Operating with a limited budget, I have constantly had to innovate new possibilities for cost reduction which often result in inventing unconventional methods for manufacturing.

Being a mechanical engineering intern at SAVIT Corporation advanced my technical knowledge of mechanical systems and gave me the industry experience necessary to view engineering problems holistically. I was able to use the collaborative skills that I learned being a team lead in Formula SAE to work with a team of engineers from many majors to produce electro mechanical prototypes with hardware and software components. 

Experience on the Formula SAE team and past internships have taught me how holistic approaches have to be applied to engineering problems. One manufacturing method which I have found to be underutilized additive manufacturing is in industry. This has caused me to devote a significant amount of my time to participate in research where I have been studying how the microstructure of additive manufactured metals can be optimized to increase strength. 

I hope to apply the skills I have learned from my past experience to innovate new solutions to a completely new set of engineering problems. Feel free to email me or check out my engineering portfolio for more information on the projects that I have worked on.
