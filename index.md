# About me

I am a heavily motivated third year Mechanical Engineering student minoring in Aerospace Engineering and Business with a variety of out-of-classroom experience from being involved with research, internships, and a Formula One style racing team. These opportunities have provided me with a sense of intuition necessary to solve complex engineering problems. I would like to expand upon the skills I have gained and apply them to a summer 2020 internship.
