# About Me

I am a third year Mechanical Engineering student minoring in Aerospace Engineering and Business with a passion for innovation. I have had the incredible experiences of being involved with multiple engineering projects which has given me the ability to perform holistically as an engineer. Metal additive manufacturing research, a Formula One style engineering team, internships, and volunteer engineering work, have given me the opportunity to build my skill set and apply knowledge learned in the classroom to real world problems. Experience working in these organizations have given me the sense of intuition and holistic mindset required to solve new complex engineering problems.

My experiences being a design lead on Lehighâ€™s Formula SAE team taught me the different roles that innovation can play in problem solving. Operating with limited resources, I have constantly had to find new opportunities to reduce costs and manufacturing time which has resulted in producing novel solutions without sacrificing quality.

Being a mechanical engineering intern at SAVIT Corporation advanced my technical knowledge of mechanical systems and provided me with the industry experience required to solve engineering problems holistically. I was able to use the collaborative skills that I learned from being a team lead in Formula SAE to successfully work with a team of interdisciplinary engineers to produce electromechanical prototypes with intertwined hardware and software components.

Considering its ability to make geometrically complex but perfectly optimized designs a reality, additive manufacturing is particularly underutilized in industry. Using a Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) printer, my research group and I are developing models to predict the strength of metal 3D printed parts using thermal data, audio information, and laser scans in real time. Through optimizing the microstructure of metal additive manufactured parts, I hope to increase the feasibility of metal additive manufacturing so it can be utilized as a solution to a completely new set of problems.

Experience performing research, being a design lead in Formula SAE and past internships have provided me with the sense of intuition and collaborative skills required to solve complex engineering problems. I hope to apply the skills I have learned from my past experiences to innovate new engineering methods for whatever challenges the future brings.
